‚ú® Features
üßÆ Quantum Circuit Simulation: Build and simulate circuits with a variety of common quantum gates (H, X, Y, Z, CNOT, Toffoli, etc.).

üîó Entanglement & Superposition: Clearly visualize and inspect fundamental quantum mechanics principles.

üìä State Vector & Probabilities: Inspect the full quantum state vector and probability distributions after each operation.

üîÑ Measurement Simulation: Simulate realistic outcomes by running circuits for multiple "shots" and observing the resulting distribution.

üñ•Ô∏è Extensible Design: The object-oriented structure makes it easy to add new gates or quantum algorithms.

üìò Educational Focus: An excellent tool for students and enthusiasts to learn quantum concepts without the barrier of real hardware.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to get the simulator up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later

pip package manager

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-simulator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd quantum-simulator
Install the required dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
üìö Usage Example
Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to create and simulate a Bell state, which is a fundamental example of quantum entanglement.

Circuit Diagram:

q_0: |0> --H---‚óè---
             |
q_1: |0> -----X---
Sample Code (examples/bell_state.py):

Python

from quantum_simulator.circuit import QuantumCircuit

# 1. Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits
circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)

# 2. Apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit
circuit.h(0)

# 3. Apply a CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate
circuit.cnot(0, 1)

# 4. Simulate the circuit 1024 times (shots)
circuit.measure(shots=1024)

# 5. Print the results
print("State Vector:", circuit.state_vector)
print("\nMeasurement Results:")
circuit.print_results()

Expected Output:

The simulation will produce an approximately equal probability distribution between the ‚à£00‚ü© and ‚à£11‚ü© states.

State Vector: [0.707+0.j 0.   +0.j 0.   +0.j 0.707+0.j]

Measurement Results:
|00‚ü© : 50.2% (514 shots)
|11‚ü© : 49.8% (510 shots)
--------------------
Total shots: 1024
üîÆ Roadmap
We have exciting plans for the future! Here are some of the features we are working on:

[ ] Advanced Algorithms: Support for key quantum algorithms like Grover‚Äôs search, Shor‚Äôs algorithm, and the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).

[ ] Bloch Sphere Visualization: An interactive tool to visualize the state of a single qubit.

[ ] Backend Integration: Optional integration with real quantum backends like IBM Qiskit, Amazon Braket, etc.

[ ] Noise Modeling: Introduce realistic noise models to simulate errors found in today's quantum hardware.

[ ] Circuit Export: Functionality to export circuits to standard formats like QASM.
